# Seating-preferences-of-Metrotech-visitors
Analysis of seating preferences through temperature, humidity and video data.

The focus of this project is to better understand what measurable factors play a role in where citizens choose to sit in public spaces. Public space and outdoor seating has become an especially important topic in New York due to the airborne COVID-19 pandemic; outdoor space became the only place in the last year plus for folks to safely socialize. Even early in the pandemic, many experts knew that being outside was safer than inside (â€œKeep the Parks Open'', The Atlantic) as people flocked to parks and outdoor recreation areas. 

Though the pandemic looks to be calmer in 2021 than 2020, people are still gathering outdoors, and New York, just like other metropolitan areas, will have to keep up in its efforts to satiate this growing demand. 

Our hope is that by using the sensors available to us, we can quantitatively identify why some seating areas in MetroTech Plaza are preferable to others - and then generalize these takeaways for the city to take advantage of across the 5 boroughs.
