# Seating-preferences-of-Metrotech-visitors
Analysis of seating preferences through temperature, humidity and video data.


## Overview


The focus of this project is to better understand what measurable factors play a role in where citizens choose to sit in public spaces. Public space and outdoor seating has become an especially important topic in New York due to the airborne COVID-19 pandemic; outdoor space became the only place in the last year plus for folks to safely socialize. Even early in the pandemic, many experts knew that being outside was safer than inside as people flocked to parks and outdoor recreation areas. 

Though the pandemic looks to be calmer in 2021 than 2020, people are still gathering outdoors, and New York, just like other metropolitan areas, will have to keep up in its efforts to satiate this growing demand. 

Our hope is that by using the sensors available to us, we can quantitatively identify why some seating areas in MetroTech Plaza are preferable to others - and then generalize these takeaways for the city to take advantage of across the 5 boroughs.

We decided to cconduct this study on the Lawrence St alleyway of the Metro Tech Plaza in Downtown Brooklyn. A 2016 New York Times and NYU Tandon collaboration provides clear evidence that the plaza receives different amounts of light in the springtime throughout the day (“Mapping the Shadows of New York City: Every Building, Every Block”). The Lawrence St. alleyway that we were able to study is mostly in shade throughout the Spring/Fall, but during approximately 10% of the day receives direct sunlight

## Hypothesis

In the moderate spring weather, people will prefer to utilize seats and tables that are in directly-lit, warmer areas during the daytime compared to shaded areas. Using existing open data, we anticipate that the directly-sunlit part of the plaza will be more utilized than shaded counterparts.


## Methodology

1. Data Collection 
2. Data Processing
3. Data Analysis 

### 1. Data Collection


To document seating choices in MetroTech Plaza, we recorded video imagery using a Samsung Galaxy S10 mobile phone (with 1080p video at 30 fps) from the northeast corner of the alleyway labeled in Figure 2a (adjacent to the Five Guys store). We found a relatively unobstructed view of both shaded and sunlit bench areas. Approximately 20 minutes of video data was captured on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 from 12:12 PM  to 12:32 PM.
